# wr-AI-ter
 
This application was written with XCode Version 15.0 and tested on iOS 17/iPadOS 17.

To use this application change the variable "apiToken" in the file "AI.swift" to a valid API-Key.

Please visit the [dev branch](https://github.com/Think-42/wr-AI-ter/tree/dev?tab=readme-ov-file) for the latest update (paper version).

In our IMX 2024 paper [wr-AI-ter: Enhancing Ownership Perception in AI-Driven Script Writing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3639701.3656325) we share our insights on how we developed wr-AI-ter, an interactive app with four stages: Ideation, Structure, Refinement, and Export. This tool assists screenwriters of all levels, maintaining their sense of authorship.
A study with 23 participants from different backgrounds showed that AI can speed up script writing and improve the quality of scripts without authors losing their sense of ownership.

Stay tuned, we are continuing to develop wr-AI-ter and will be making some announcements soon.
